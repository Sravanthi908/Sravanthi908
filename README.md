Hi 👋 I'm Lakshmi Sravanthi

I enjoy building real-world applications and understanding how systems work internally.

💻 Full Stack Developer
⚙️ Tech: React, Django, REST APIs, MongoDB
🧠 Interested in backend systems & problem solving

Projects I’m proud of:
• MediConnect – Healthcare appointment platform with location-based hospital search
• SymptomTrackAI – Context-aware medical chatbot

I like breaking systems, debugging them, and rebuilding them better.
